## Write up of study

A preprint is being prepared. Methods, and Results are regularly updated in our online Jupyter Book [https://tommonks.github.io/treatment-centre-sim](https://tommonks.github.io/treatment-centre-sim)

## Aims of the study

The overarching aim of our study is to identify robust ways that python discrete-event simulation models can be shared with other health researchers and NHS care providers.

Specific objectives of the study that this code supports are:

1. Outline a straightforward framework for deploying a simulation developed in Python on the web for users of varying technical skills;
2. Provide an applied simulation example implementing our framework;
3. Provide guidance for modellers to **begin** haring models built using FOSS via the web.
